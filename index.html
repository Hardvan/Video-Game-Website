          Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has
          up to eight players assigned to each of the two teams, using
          rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and
          score points over the course of a match. The game includes
          single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally
          and online, including cross-platform play between all versions. Later
          updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and
          added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and
          basketball.<sup><a href="#refer1">[1]</a></sup>

          Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to
          seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled
          by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, an
          inter-dimensional adventurer who, at the start of the game, is
          separated from their twin sibling after the two land in Teyvat.
          Thereafter, the Traveler journeys across the nations of Teyvat in
          search of the lost sibling, accompanied by their guide, Paimon. Along
          the way, the two befriend myriad individuals and begin to unravel the
          mysteries of the land.<sup><a href="#refer2">[2]</a></sup>

          In Brawl Stars, players battle against other players or AI opponents
          in multiple game modes. Players can choose between characters called
          Brawlers that they have unlocked through Boxes, the Brawl Pass, the
          Trophy Road, or purchased through the Shop to use in battles. In
          December 2022, Boxes were removed, and all previous methods to get
          them were replaced with credits and chroma credits, which are used to
          unlock Brawlers, who are now mostly placed on the "Starr Road".<sup
